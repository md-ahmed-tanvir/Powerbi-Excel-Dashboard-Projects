## Dashboard Project (Using Excel, PowerBi & SQl)

Hello, everyone! I hope you’re having a great day.  In this repository, I’m excited to share my Dashboards which I have created using PowerBi, where the data is cleaned using Excel and SQL to use in PowerBi. These projects showcase my ability to use Power BI, Excel & SQl for data visualization and analysis, helping to transform raw data into insightful dashboards and reports.

Through these projects, I aim to demonstrate my skills in connecting to various data sources, performing data transformations, and creating interactive visualizations that highlight key trends and insights. Each project includes detailed documentation and examples to guide you through the analysis process.

I hope you find my work helpful for your own projects and data analysis journey. If you have any questions or need support, feel free to reach out!
